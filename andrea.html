	 <p style="color: black"> Introduction: My name is Andrea Nebria and i would like to describe myself with this website.

	 	<br>


	 <p style="color : black">Information: I was born in Legazpi city, on October 21, 2007 I am currently living at Paulog ligao city.
	 	I am the first daughter of my parents (basically because i have a older brother) but I have 2 more little sisters.I am creative and ambitious young woman because I have a lot of idea about my future. I am interested to all kind of arts and music. Also I love all kinds of animals except for snakes,
	 	I love to pet my dogs (their name is Hunter and Spotty)
	 	<br>


	 <p style="color: black">Hobby: I have devoting the majority of my free time to do what I love most: Watching anime and Playing online games.
	 	It is just wonderful to let myself lose into a whole new world every time I watch new seasons of anime It can be a fascinating world of magic in 
	 	"Wandering witch: The journey of Elaina" I was born with the desire to explore the world but my current situation does not give me any chance to do so.

	 	Watching anime has the ability to change my life, watching helps develop a sense of creativity, etc.
	 	<br>


	 	<p style="color: black">Motto: "PUSH YOURSELF, BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE IS GOING TO DO IT FOR YOU."
	 		<br>


	 	<p style="color: black">Family:	My Family is a typical Filipino family. There are my parents, My older brother (he is 18 years old)
	 	   and my other two sisters and me.My mother is a housewife, she is a nice and friendly person and likes to talk with other people 
	 	   (I also like to go out and talk to other people.) My father works as a Teacher and he is the opposite of my mother because he is quiet and just wants to share 
	 		his free time with his wife and 4 kids. I have a good relationship with my siblings and my parents. Sometimes there is a little
	 		quarrel but i think this is normal and we try to resolve our problems together
